# Background generator

This project is part of the [@zerotomastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) JavaScript task, focusing on creating a gradient generator with additional features.

## Overview

### Basic Functionality (Provided by the Course)

We began with a shared function, `setGradient()`, which allowed users to set a gradient based on the colors selected with input elements. 

### Additional Opportunities (Optional)

As part of the course, the following optional tasks were suggested for students to explore:

1. **Match Background on Page Load**: write code that makes the color inputs match the background gradient generated on the first page load.

2. **Display Initial CSS Linear Gradient Property**: display the initial CSS linear gradient property upon page load. I also included a reset button for users to revert to this initial state.

3. **BONUS: Add a Random Button**: As an additional challenge, I created a "Random" button that generates two random colors for the gradient. Initially, I developed a random RGB generator function on my own, but later I found a more efficient solution and linked the source in the JavaScript file's comment section.
