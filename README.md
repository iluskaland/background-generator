# background-generator

This is a @zerotomastery javascript task.   
We had a basic function that worked: the setGradient(), which set the gradient according to the color is picked with the input elements.

The additional tasks were to add some more functionality, such as: 
  - write code so that the colour inputs match the background generated on the first page load, 
  - display the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load (I also created a reset button for that)
  - BONUS: Add a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs
For the bonus, I've created a random rgb generator function, but for that to work, I should have also create an additional function instead of an existing one, so I moved on from that and searched for a hex generator function.
I've linked the source I found in my javascript file's comment section.
